      "info_text": "The famous singing fish toy, known as 'Big Mouth Billy Bass', is not a true robot but rather an animatronic novelty item popular in the early 2000s. It features pre-programmed movements and songs activated by a motion sensor. Unlike Furhat (a social robotics platform with advanced projection capabilities) and other robotic toys, singing fish toys lack autonomous decision-making abilities, sensors for environmental interaction, or adaptive learning capabilities that define true robots.",
