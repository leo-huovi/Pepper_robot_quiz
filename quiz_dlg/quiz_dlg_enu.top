concept:(q1) Which one is NOT a robot?
concept:(q2) Which one of these is NOT a humanoid robot?
concept:(q3) Which one is NOT a social robot?
concept:(q4) Which robot is NOT used in education?
concept:(q5) Which robot is NOT used in elder care?

concept:(q1i) \pau=1000\ The famous singing fish toy "Big Mouth Billy Bass" is an animatronic noveltyâ€”not a true robot with intelligent behavior. We robots need sensors, processors, and the ability to interact with our environment autonomously! \pau=1000\
concept:(q2i) \pau=1000\ Vacuum robots, like a Roomba, are built purely for a task and do not mimic human appearance like a humanoid robot. Unlike me, they don't have arms, a head, or a torso designed to resemble humans! \pau=1000\
concept:(q3i) \pau=1000\ Although the singing cactus can move and produce sounds, it lacks the sophisticated interactive and social capabilities of social robots. Social robots like me can engage in conversations, recognize emotions, and adapt to human interaction patterns! \pau=1000\
concept:(q4i) \pau=1000\ The delivery robot is designed for retail purposes and does not possess the features typically built into educational robots for interactive learning. Educational robots need to be programmed with teaching protocols and learning algorithms! \pau=1000\
concept:(q5i) \pau=1000\ NASA's robots are engineered for space and exploration tasks and are not intended for the compassionate roles seen in elder care robots. Elder care robots require special sensors and programming to monitor health and provide companionship! \pau=1000\
